# Projects
In this Projects, we will analyze a Health insurance company's data to predict insurance premium amounts and identify factors that lead to higher healthcare costs. The insurance dataset consists of 1,338 policyholders with 7 attributes that describe their health and demographic information. The variable we would like to predict is the Premium charges, that a policyholder will have to opt for, to provide a more targeted Charges prediction.

Technologies Used:
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries and Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Model Evaluation Metrics: Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, R-squared.

Key Achievements:
Developed a predictive model with high accuracy in estimating insurance costs.
Provided actionable insights into the key factors affecting insurance premiums.
Delivered a practical tool for insurers and customers to estimate insurance costs effectively.

Documentation and Reporting: 
Documented the entire project workflow, including data preprocessing steps, model selection rationale, and performance metrics. Provided a detailed report summarizing findings and recommendations for future improvements.

Objectives:
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathered and cleaned a dataset containing historical insurance information. This data included features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and geographical location. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to understand the relationships between features and the target variable (insurance cost). This step involved visualizing data distributions, identifying patterns, and detecting outliers to inform feature selection and model choice.

Feature Engineering: Developed new features and transformed existing ones to enhance the model’s performance. This included creating interaction terms and aggregating features to capture complex relationships within the data.

Model Selection and Training: Evaluated various machine learning algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Machines. Compared model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. Chose the best-performing model based on these metrics.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuned the selected model to improve its predictive accuracy. This process involved optimizing hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search and validating the model’s performance through cross-validation.

Model Evaluation: Assessed the final model's performance on a test dataset to ensure its generalizability. Analyzed the model’s residuals and performed error analysis to understand its strengths and limitations.
